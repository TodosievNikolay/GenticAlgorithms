# Genetic Algorithm – Traveling Salesman Problem

This project is a Python implementation of a Genetic Algorithm
used to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP).

The program loads TSP files, runs random search, greedy algorithm
and a genetic algorithm, and prints results to the console.

## What I practiced in this project

- Python basics (functions, lists, loops)
- Reading and parsing `.tsp` files
- Euclidean distance calculation
- Greedy algorithm
- Genetic Algorithm:
  - tournament selection
  - ordered crossover
  - inversion mutation
  - elitism
- Comparing algorithms using console output
